**Common question**: why are we spreading our software across several different files?

The answer is: software **MUST** be easy to change.

That's what the term **soft** in soft-ware means. As opposed to hard-ware.

So, we are creating all this different files so we can make our software easier to change, even if sacrificing the easiness to write. Of course we want easier ways to write software, but making it easier to change is a priority.
